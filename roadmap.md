On the upcoming versions I would like to add:
1. Separate engine code into its own npm package that the drawing app requires
2. Documentation for engine
3. 100% test coverage for engine
4. Colors
    * UI to switch colors
        1. pick your own color
        2. rainbow color, every vertex is a different color
5. Make all shapes of same type render from one buffer(if possible)
6. Shape preview: so users can see what they are drawring as they are drawing it
7. add icons for UI menu of drawing app to make it
8. Point size/Line thickness
9. Add icons for each shape/renderMode
    * change icon of main ui button to reflect the current shape/rendermode being drawn
10. Render mode menu only available when in developer mode(settings UI needed)
